# Counter

This is my second project I created from the **Javascript Basics Start2Impact's** guide.

## Start2impact

You can find all the info [here](https://www.start2impact.it/percorsi/) about start2impact courses.

## Javascript Basics

This project is about creating a simple counter, it's a good practice for beginners.

You can practice to:

- Create simple logic
- Having a clean and understandable syntax
- Adding html tags through javascript
- Adding and removing classes from javascript

You can find all the documentation of Javascript [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript?retiredLocale).
